# Annotation for Relationship Extractions

This annotation tool was designed to be fed into input of [rel_component](https://github.com/explosion/projects/tree/v3/tutorials/rel_component), an **Entity Relation Extractions** tutorial project by [Explosion.ai](https://explosion.ai), maintainer of [spaCy](https://spacy.io). 

As that projects uses input `jsonl` file annotated with `Prodigy` (Advanced annotation tool also by [Explosion.ai](https://explosion.ai])), this tool aims to imitate that annotation process (Unlike, `Prodigy`, no annotation suggestions are provided).

But, to minimize the cumbersome process, this tool already prepopulated each **texts**, **tokens** and **entities**. While *relations* fields were already filled in, values are set to default, namely, `No-rel` (*No relations*).
With the following predefined relations, this tool helps to simplify the relations annotation process.

### Category Definitions (w/o Directions)

Consulting several papers, the following is a proposed categorization of relations between entities. (The example sentences below are not always based on the facts.)

### Directions encoding

In view of sentiment analyses, directions between each entity is empirical. For the purpose, it makes sense to simplify by only(?) having three labels for the direction. (i.e., **over**, **under**, **[*pos/neg*]-inline**)

- `Over` - **A** verb **B** (A: positive, B: negative)
- `Under` - **A** verb **B** (A: negative, B: positive)
- `Posline` - **A** verb **B** (A: positive, B: positive)
- `Negline` - **A** verb **B** (A: negative, B: negative)
- `Pos` - **A** verb *(B)* (A: positive, B: neutral)
- `Neg` - **A** verb *(B)* (A: negative, B: neutral)


### Relations format

Combining both directions and categories, relations are formed as the following format.

`Direction`-`Category`

For instance, in the first sentence (**Microsoft** agreed to buy stakes in **Activision**.), the relation between `Microsoft`-`Activision` is `Under`-`Buy`.

It is because Microsoft is given inferior sentiment in the act of buying Activision. (Inferior sentiment in financial context)
