# Annotation for Relationship Extractions

This annotation tool was designed to be fed into input of [rel_component](https://github.com/explosion/projects/tree/v3/tutorials/rel_component), an **Entity Relation Extractions** tutorial project by [Explosion.ai](https://explosion.ai), maintainer of [spaCy](https://spacy.io). As the project requires the entities and their relations in `jsonl` file format, this tool already prepopulated each **texts**, **tokens** and **entities**. While *relations* fields were already filled in, values are set to default, namely, `No-rel` (*No relations*).
Given the predefined relations, this tool helps to simplify the relations annotation process.
